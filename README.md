# webscraper

Web scraper is used to get the data from U-Haul's website. Data includes information about all storage facilities in the US
and available units at each facility. 
To successfully run the script, use vpn with location in the US, since the script accesses the US U-Haul website.

uhaul_webscraper is the main file, in the Jupyter Notebook format.

all_states.xlsx file contains list of all major cities in the US, and the scraper goes through that list while searching
for storage facilities.

Python version 3.8.8
